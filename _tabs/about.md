My name is Armin Sarkozi and I'm a student at one of the best schools in Hungary. I'm into competitive programming and mathematics. I love libraries, books and learning. You can find my Goodreads [here](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/179054781-armin-sarkozi). I think knowledge is power. I'm into science but there are a lot of interesting things in the world to mention so I write about them on this website.
It is also an important fact about me that I love bunnies! I have a little cute bunny, Jim. He has brown fur and white paws. He's just so adorable!!!!
